      <h1>About the City</h1>
      <p class="about-city">London, the capital of England and the United Kingdom, is a 21st-century city with history
        stretching back to Roman times. At its centre stand the imposing Houses of Parliament, the iconic ‘Big Ben’
        clock tower and Westminster Abbey, site of British monarch coronations. Across the Thames River, the London Eye
        observation wheel provides panoramic views of the South Bank cultural complex, and the entire city (Wikipedia,
        2022).</p>

            <p>Fish and chips is a popular hot dish consisting of fried fish in crispy batter, served with chips. The
              dish originated in England, where these two components had been introduced from separate immigrant
              cultures; it is not known who created the culinary fusion that became the emblematic British meal
              (Wikipedia, 2021).
