      <p class="about-city">
        Venice is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. Venice has been known as "La
        Dominante", "La Serenissima", "Queen of the Adriatic", "City of Water", "City of Masks", "City of Bridges", "The
        Floating City", and "City of Canals". The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage
        Site. Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork.[3] Venice
        is known for several important artistic movements—especially during the Renaissance period—and has played an
        important role in the history of instrumental and operatic music, and is the birthplace of Baroque composers
        Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi (Wikipedia, 2022).

              <p>
                The Patriarchal Cathedral Basilica of Saint Mark, commonly known as St Mark's Basilica, is the
                cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Patriarchate of Venice in northern Italy.
                The interior of the domes was slowly covered with roughly 8,500 square metres (91,000 sq ft) of
                gold-ground mosaics depicting saints, prophets, and biblical scenes. Many of these mosaics were later
                retouched or remade as artistic tastes changed and damaged mosaics had to be replaced, such that the
                mosaics represent eight hundred years of artistic styles (Wikipedia, 2022).
