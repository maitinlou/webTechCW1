      <p class="about-city">
        Paris is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated population of
        2,165,423 residents in 2019 in an area of more than 105 square kilometres (41 square miles). Since the 17th
        century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy,
        science, and arts (Wikipedia, 2021).

            <h2>Sainte-Chapelle</h2>
            <p>The Sainte-Chapelle is a royal chapel in the Gothic style, within the medieval Palais de la Cité, the
              residence of the Kings of France until the 14th century, on the Île de la Cité in the River Seine in
              Paris, France.
              Construction began sometime after 1238 and the chapel was consecrated on 26 April 1248. The
              Sainte-Chapelle is considered among the highest achievements of the Rayonnant period of Gothic
              architecture. It was commissioned by King Louis IX of France to house his collection of Passion relics,
              including Christ's Crown of Thorns - one of the most important relics in medieval Christendom, later
              hosted in the nearby Notre-Dame Cathedral until the 2019 fire, which it survived (WIkipedia, 2022).

            <h2>Pain Au Chocolat</h2>
            <p>Pain au chocolat , literally "chocolate bread", is a type of viennoiserie sweet pastry consisting of a
              cuboid-shaped piece of yeast-leavened laminated dough, similar in texture to a puff pastry, with one or
              two pieces of dark chocolate in the center (Wikipedia, 2022).

              Legend has it that Marie-Antoinette introduced the croissant to France. The type of pastry, called
              viennoiserie in French, was introduced in the early 19th century, when August Zang, an Austrian officer,
              and Ernest Schwarzer, an Austrian aristocrat, founded a Viennese bakery in Paris located at 92, rue de
              Richelieu (Wikipedia, 2022).
